HTML and CSS were used to implement this website. I used many flexboxes to assist in the page's layout. Formatting took some time but I was able to successfully add a form, various hover features, and a mobile version.

Note: I unfortunately did not see the note for a screenshot of the layout stage before I passed that phase.
